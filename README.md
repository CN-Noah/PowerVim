# FAQ
PowerVim do not install youcompleteme to perfect code completion
* PowerVim basic code completion is enough
* Installing youcompleteme is complicated and is not almost universal, one install successfully do not mean other people can install it successfully in same operation method.
* Open vim will be slow. Because youcompleteme is to large, it load bin file and analyze syntax.
* PowerVim will try it latter, if it is easy to install and use.
